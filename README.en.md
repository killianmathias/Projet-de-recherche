During our curriculum L2 CMI Informatique, we had the opportunity to work on a research project. The subject of this research project is the procedural generation of sets.
Our goal is therefore to reproduce a simplified version of terraria by generating blocks so as to create mountains, plains, etc. We would also like to move towards the generation of biomes, caves and possibly minerals.
To achieve this goal, we must therefore seek procedural algorithms that can meet our needs. At first, to generate the blocks procedurally, we want to orient ourselves towards the noise of Perlin, then for the other features we have not yet wanted algorithms that meet these needs. In addition, we must take into account the optimization of this generation, in particular the noise of Perlin in order to not generate the whole map in 1 time but rather in the form of a chunk (generation zone).

In order to achieve our goal of achieving the simplified terraria, we have chosen Python and its pygame library because the latter simplified everything related to the visual application, which will therefore allow us to focus on the implementation of procedural generation algorithms.

To find out a little more, I invite you to consult our research report.
